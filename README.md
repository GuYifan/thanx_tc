## General Idea

To identify users who are eligible to become VIP based on the purchase records is done in 3 steps, and they are retrieving data, transform data to be aggregated by dates, then use a "sliding window" strategy to calculate the amount each user spent in this period and identify users whose amount meets the threshold.

1. **Step 1 - Retrieve Data**
 
   Read data from a given text file.

2. **Step 2 - Transform Data**
 
   Iterate through the raw data and aggregate by date. As shown in the example below, each key is the date and the value is each user's purchase amount on that date.

   Example:
```
{'2020-12-02': { '1': 22.2 },
'2020-12-30': { '1': 38.8, '2': 18.1, '3': 13.3, '4': 52.3, '5': 52.3 },
'2021-01-15': { '2': 50.6, '6': 11.8 },
'2021-02-12': { '1': 50.8, '3': 54.2, '4': 25.5, '6': 40.7, '6': 50.8 }}
```

3. **Step 3 - Calculate Each User's Purchase Total Amount within the Given Period**
 
   Iterate through data from step 2 using a sliding window strategy. The sliding window represents the given period (e.g. 2 months). Also, keep an record of each user's total spend amount for this period as the example below, which means in this period from '2021-01-10' to '2021-01-10' user 1 spent $221.5 and so on.

```
begin: '2020-12-02'
end: '2020-12-30'
{"1": 61,
  "2": 18.1,
  "3": 13.3,
  "4": 52.3,
  "5": 52.3}
```

* First, Anchor the beginning of the window to the first date and move forward the end of the window in each iteration.  
* As the end of the window moves forward, if the distance between begin and end becomes bigger than the given period, then move begin forward as well, and update the user spent amount by subtracting the amount spend between the old begin and the new begin.
* Lastly, in each iteration, check if any user's total amount reaches the threshold. If so, add the user to the result list.


## How to Run
```npm run test --filename=data.txt --threshold=100 --months=2```

The default value for threshold is 200 if not given.
The default value for months is 2 if not given.

## How to Generate Test Data
```npm run generate --months=1 --number=100```

The generated file will be saved to ```./test_data.txt``` in the same directory.
The default value for months is 2 if not given.
The default value for nubmer of records is 100 if not given.

## Unit Tests
```npm run jest```

## Complexity Analysis
Assume the number of records is N.

Step 1 reads all records so time is O(N).

Step 2 iterates all records so so time is O(N). Space complexity is O(N) becuase needs to save all transformed data.

Step 3 has two loops. The first loop is to go through all records. The second one is when moving forward the beginning of the window, it needs to iterate through from the old begin to new begin to calculate the amount to subctract so worst case scenario is (N-1). Thus the total complexity is O(N^2). Space complexity is O(M) and M is the number of users.

## Optimization
Step 3 could be optimized for shorter time by using more storage. Can use extra memory to store the amount spent from (that date - months) to that date for each date, so that don't need the second loop to calculate the amount to subtract. This would improve step 3 to O(N) but need additional space O(MD) and D is the number of dates and M is the number of users.I just think the worst case scenario will only very rarely happen in reality so went with the current implementation.
